CPL Input Board
===============

This board converts 8 analog inputs into digital outputs. First it converts the analog input into
the digital range, where < 2V is low and higher is high, and then uses opto-isolators
between the converted input and the output to prevent damage from downstream
boards that read the digital state.

This board has not been produced.
